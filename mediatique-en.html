üì® Message received on 10 June 2025 at 17:38, sent by Ms.Opposing Party‚Äôs Lawyer:

"Dear Sir,

Please find attached, for proper order, a copy of the petition that we have just filed via e-Deposit, along with the accompanying documents. These documents are entirely known to you, as they merely provide an overview of the communication exchanged between the parties.

The case has not yet been assigned a docket number and no introductory hearing date has yet been determined. You will receive notification in due course.

Kind regards,

Opposing Party‚Äôs Lawyer, Attorney"

---
üìé Documents received:
1. Verzoekschrift huur Temmerman ‚Äì Raitano (termination).pdf
2. Stukkenbundel.pdf

These two documents were transmitted without any reference to PJ32, the in-effect procedural freeze, or the public prosecutor. The content of the "verzoekschrift" summarizes previous exchanges in a partial and unilateral manner, without any mention of the active criminal procedure. The document also contains an explicit request for early termination of the lease agreement, without adversarial process or acknowledgment of the ongoing case, which may be interpreted as a veiled form of pressure aimed at unilateral eviction.

---
üìå Legal elements retained in PJ34:

1. The response occurred after the expiration of the freeze imposed by PJ32 (9 June 2025 at 14:26), without any formal reply within the allotted timeframe.
2. The submission of a unilateral civil petition, without prior notification or commitment to the four PJ32 conditions, constitutes a clear violation of the stabilization framework.
3. This action immediately triggers the PJ33 effect: exclusive continuation on criminal grounds.
4. The lack of coordination with the public prosecutor (no copy, no reference to case file COR/470) constitutes procedurally disloyal behavior.
5. The indirectly intimidating nature of the act ‚Äì through accumulation of annexes and reactivation of a civil conflict ‚Äì constitutes a disguised attempt at judicial pressure.
6. The request for lease termination without alignment or respect for the criminal channels constitutes an eviction attempt in breach of fundamental procedural safeguards.

---
üì£ FX1 Conclusion

PJ34 officially registers this procedural violation and was submitted to the public prosecutor in Leuven on 10 June 2025 at 20:15, with a loyal copy to the opposing counsel. Any further attempt at parallel civil proceedings will henceforth be regarded as abusive.

All future communication must strictly pass through the public prosecutor. The FX1 system records this response as sealed, opposable, and time-stamped.

<p>From: [Opposing Party‚Äôs Lawyer]
To: [Mr. Raitano]
Subject: Technical Coordination ‚Äì Longin Intervention

Dear Mr. Raitano,

Since you refuse to have any direct contact with my client, can you confirm to me that you will contact Longin to schedule an appointment for a camera inspection, unclogging, and the preparation of a technical report?

My client does not know when you will be home (and available) to receive the company. The entire process is being unnecessarily complicated due to your refusal to communicate directly.

Can you also answer the following questions (already asked several times by my client):

- Front door subsidence: Without a photo, the construction firm cannot schedule an intervention and the problem remains unaddressed.
- Blocked drain: How long has the sewer been clogged? Are the toilets still functioning?
- Dishwasher: According to Ixina, there may be a leak at the door causing further damage to the kitchen, especially to the skirting board and the door panel. This is a priority issue and cannot be ignored. Please provide an update. You were to be contacted by BSH for an intervention‚Äîhas this occurred? Cf. email of 29/04/2025.
- Garden fence: This needs to be repaired to prevent further damage. My client has been waiting for over three weeks for your availability to execute this. Cf. email of 07/05/2025.

Let it be perfectly clear: there is no question of "intimidation" or "pressure." My client seeks a resolution and explains who bears which costs based on the identified cause.

As previously indicated, we are continuing with the preparation of a petition to dissolve the lease at your expense. At this point, no normal (let alone constructive) contact is possible.

Sincerely,  
[Opposing Party‚Äôs Lawyer]

To: [Mr. Raitano]
Subject: Intervention ‚Äì Unclogging and Inspection

Dear Stefan,

Please respond to the points below so that the interventions can be carried out:

- The tenant (you) is invited to contact Longin (or another company) for an intervention: camera inspection, unclogging, and a detailed technical report.
- If the issue is not a technical defect, the costs are to be borne by the tenant, and you may contact your fire insurance.
- If it is a technical defect, the costs and repairs fall to the construction company.

Please send me all the photos‚ÄîI have not received them.

I am also still awaiting your response to my email of 03/06/2025 (attached).

Best regards,  
[Landlord]

<br/>
<p>From: [Opposing Party‚Äôs Lawyer]
To: [Mr. Raitano]
Subject: Follow-up to your report of 2 June 2025

Dear Sir,

I do not understand why you state that there was no intervention or response following your report dated 2 June 2025.

My client contacted you promptly and repeatedly with specific questions about the issues you reported, to which you did not respond. These emails are again attached, along with a request that you promptly inform my client so she can take the necessary steps and properly inform the companies involved.

You speak of a ‚Äútotal contact ban‚Äù with my client while simultaneously demanding that she schedules an intervention within seven days. When my client contacts you in that regard, you do not respond to the questions but instead email the public prosecutor alleging harassment. This is completely absurd.

To be clear: a landlord‚Äôs failure to intervene immediately in the event of an issue with the rented property does not constitute a criminal offence.

In fact, your conduct is obstructing the resolution of the issues for which you are addressing my client. She has also noted that you do not properly maintain the garden, and that you clean the dishwasher up to three times a day with vinegar, which damages the seals and causes further damage to the skirting boards and kitchen cupboards.

Furthermore, you have blocked my email address while insisting on communicating only by registered post‚Äîyet you continue to send numerous emails, each containing defamatory statements.

My client also notes that your ‚Äúwebsite‚Äù remains online.

You are thereby creating a completely untenable situation for my client, which renders any normal landlord-tenant relationship impossible and compels her to incur additional costs due to our ongoing involvement.

We will therefore take the necessary steps to prepare a petition seeking the termination of the lease at your expense.

In addition, we are taking steps to obtain further information on the criminal proceedings you have initiated and are exploring options available to my client in this regard, including seeking legal costs before the council chamber.

This correspondence is addressed to you under all reservations and without any prejudicial acknowledgment.

Sincerely,  
[Opposing Party‚Äôs Lawyer]

To: [Mr. Raitano]
Subject: [Follow-up on intervention ‚Äì technical points]

Dear Stefan,

Please respond to the points below so that appropriate action can be taken:

- Front door subsidence: Without a photo, the construction company cannot schedule an intervention, and the problem remains unresolved.
- Blocked drainage: How long has the sewer been blocked? Are the toilets still functioning?
- Dishwasher: According to the explanation received from Ixina, there may be a leak at the door, which could cause further damage to the rest of the kitchen, as is already the case with the skirting board and the front panel of the door. This is a high-priority issue and cannot simply be ignored. Please provide an update on this. You were supposed to be contacted by BSH for an intervention‚Äîhas this taken place or not? Cf. email of 29/04/2025.
- Garden fence: This needs to be repaired to prevent further damage. I have been waiting three weeks for your information on when this can be carried out. Cf. email of 07/05/2025.

Best regards,  
[Landlord]

<h2>üìÑ Exhibit PJ16 ‚Äì Email dated 28/05/2025 from the opposing party‚Äôs lawyer</h2><p style="margin-bottom: 1em; font-weight: 500;">‚úîÔ∏è Certified FX1 ‚Äì Translation faithful to the original (Dutch) ‚Äì Opposable PJ filed with the Leuven prosecutor</p>

<p><strong>From:</strong> [Opposing Party‚Äôs Lawyer]<br/>
<strong>To:</strong> [Mr. Raitano]<br/>
<strong>Cc:</strong> [Other recipients]<br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> Voluntary payment confirmation ‚Äì Judgment No. 25A782/1 ‚Äì Justice of the Peace of Leuven</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Raitano,</p>
<p>We acknowledge receipt of your message below and confirm that the payment has also been received in good order on our third-party account.</p>
<p>Could you, for the sake of completeness, confirm that you will continue to pay the full rent in the future, including indexation amounts, as stipulated by the judgment of the Justice of the Peace?</p>
<p>We are also very surprised that, without our client‚Äôs consent, you created a publicly accessible website on which our client‚Äôs personal data is processed and which outlines the legal procedures that are allegedly pending between the parties.</p>
<p>Contrary to your assertions, you can under no circumstances invoke the exceptions under Articles 6(e) and 6(f) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The processing of personal data is absolutely not necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in you. Nor is the processing of our client‚Äôs personal data necessary for the purposes of your legitimate interests.</p>
<p>The website includes an overview of documentation filed in the course of the procedures and allegedly aims to (publicly!) provide access to the said documents and to ‚Äúdocument‚Äù a legal dispute.</p>
<p>It is completely unclear to us why you have created this website. If you wish to have an overview of the documentation and timeline related to the dispute, this can perfectly well be done through a Word document stored privately. There is absolutely no necessity, legal basis or justification to make such matters public without our client‚Äôs consent. You can fully exercise your rights without the existence of this website.</p>
<p>By means of this letter, you are therefore formally requested to take the website offline immediately. Should you fail to do so, our client will initiate the necessary steps to seek judicial termination of the lease agreement, also considering the fact that you are not maintaining the garden properly, that you are accusing our client of potentially criminal conduct (which our client finds utterly incomprehensible on the basis of which offenses you believe a criminal complaint could be filed), and so on. The trust of our client has been completely destroyed by your actions ‚Äì understandably so.</p>
<p>Our client obviously hopes that it will not have to come to that.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,<br/>[Opposing Party‚Äôs Lawyer]<br/>[Redacted professional contact details]</p>
