  <p style="font-size: 0.95em; color: #475569;">
    In accordance with <strong>PJ51 (June 18, 2025)</strong>, the civil party expressly reserves the right to adjust, suspend, or accelerate this calendar, depending on the development of the legal and institutional context. <br/>

  <h3 style="font-size: 1.2em; color: #0f172a;">üìà Procedural Dynamics ‚Äì Absence of Response from the Opposing Party</h3>
  <p style="font-size: 0.95em; color: #475569;">
    All documents (PJ1 to PJ14, PJ49 to PJ58) have been officially filed as part of the civil procedure and refiled with the public prosecutor in person. To date, **no response has been given** by the opposing party, neither during the initial filing nor after the transmission of the documents.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 0.95em; color: #475569;">
    This absence of objection, combined with the **publication on FX1**, strengthens the **irrefutability** of the evidence and clearly exposes the shortcomings of the opposing party. The **non-reaction** of the opposing party to these allegations and evidence, particularly in a **civil and criminal context**, allows for the **presumption of tacit acceptance** of these documents as **justified and founded**.

üìé <strong style="font-size: 1.05em;">PJ15 ‚Äì Statement of Modular Strategy (post-PJ14)</strong><br><br>
The documents <strong>PJ1 to PJ14</strong> constitute the official documentation corpus attached to the <strong>criminal complaint submitted in person on 19 May 2025</strong>, with civil party declaration, in case file <em>COR/470 ‚Äì PB/2500031</em>.<br>
The filing was registered at the clerk‚Äôs office with a stamped receipt, and then retransmitted approximately one hour later via the e-Deposit platform for probative preservation.<br>
üßæ The opposing party <strong>had full access to the case file via the judicial platform</strong> and never contested the existence or validity of the filing. No public disclosure had yet taken place on that date.<br>
The entire submission is certified under the <em>FX1-Ultima++</em> protocol.<br><br>
The documents <strong>PJ5 to PJ13</strong>, although published later, were prepared in direct continuity with this initial filing. They are part of a conditional, legally framed mechanism, activatable at any time at the discretion of the civil party.<br><br>
Their content is based on facts that <strong>had already occurred or were highly foreseeable</strong> as of the filing date, and may be <strong>contextually adapted</strong> before publication without compromising probative value.<br><br>
Each publication may be <strong>gradual, deferred, or grouped</strong>, depending on the context‚Äôs evolution, adverse maneuvers, or the civil party‚Äôs legitimate interest in public defense.<br><br>
üïì In the absence of a formal, constructive, or coordinated response from the opposing party (cf. PJ32‚ÄìPJ33), this system becomes fully activatable without prior notice or further justification.<br><br>
‚öñÔ∏è This system complies with the requirements of the <strong>GDPR</strong> (Art. 6.1.e-f), the <strong>ECHR</strong> (Art. 10), the <strong>Belgian Penal Code</strong> (Art. 151, 442bis) and is based on principles of <strong>proportionality, non-provocation, and procedural loyalty</strong>.<br><br>
üßæ This mechanism is not intended to escalate the conflict but to document a progressive, structured, and legally enforceable defense, strictly within the judicial framework.<br><br>

<h2>üì¨ Notification to the Justice of the Peace ‚Äì Confirmation of Criminal Priority</h2>
<p>
    On <strong>10 June 2025</strong>, a formal communication was sent to the <strong>clerk of the Justice of the Peace in Leuven</strong>, 
    <em>prior to any civil docket assignment or hearing</em>, with a copy to the <strong>Public Prosecutor's Office</strong> and the lawyers of the opposing party.
  </p>
<p>
    This preliminary notice reminded all parties that a <strong>criminal complaint with civil party status</strong> had already been filed on 
    <strong>19 May 2025</strong>. The civil unilateral petition submitted on the same day by the opposing party made 
    <strong>no reference whatsoever</strong> to this pending criminal procedure.  
    Documents <strong>PJ32, PJ33, PJ34, and PJ35</strong> were attached, along with a 
    <strong>certified SHA-256 hash</strong> to ensure integrity verification.
  </p>
<p>
    üîê This transparent notification has been publicly archived to prevent any attempt to <strong>bypass ongoing criminal proceedings</strong>, 
    and confirms the <strong>exclusive continuation of the criminal path</strong> 
    (<em>ref. COR/470 ‚Äì PB/2500031</em>).

üì® Message from  (lawyer of the opposing party):

‚ÄúDear Mr Raitano,

We duly acknowledge receipt of your numerous emails addressed to the clerk of the public prosecutor‚Äôs office and the council chamber, the content of which is formally contested by our client (insofar as she understands it at all).

However, our client does not understand why you are currently blocking every intervention related to the rental property, including the inspection and repair of the alleged sewer leak.

On the one hand, you reproach our client for not intervening and for failing to fulfil her duties as a landlord. On the other hand, you obstruct every attempt she makes in this regard.

It is entirely unclear to our client what you expect at this time. You refer to freezing periods and unilaterally prohibit any contact between you and our client, while focusing solely on email correspondence with the prosecutor‚Äôs office and the council chamber, which is completely unclear to our client.

Conversely, it is clear that our client cannot be blamed in this situation. She is still trying to have the relevant companies schedule an appointment to inspect and, if necessary, repair the issues you raised and will of course explain this to the justice of the peace.

Refusing the proposed interventions, as already set out in our petition, constitutes an additional contractual breach that justifies termination of the agreement between the parties.

Yours sincerely,‚Äù

    üîπ Document submitted on <strong>12 June 2025</strong> by the civil party in the context of the criminal case COR/470 ‚Äì PB/2500031.
    In accordance with the principle of procedural fairness, its full content is published here without modification.

<h3>üìé Annex PJ40 ‚Äì FX1 Ultima++ (version updated after publication of PJ15‚ÄìPJ39)</h3>
<p><strong>Case number:</strong> COR/470 ‚Äì PB/2500031<br/>
<strong>Date:</strong> 11 June 2025<br/>
<strong>Version:</strong> FX1 ‚Äì Ultima++<br/>
<strong>Type:</strong> Formal legal note ‚Äì Preventive notification in case of hypothetical dismissal<br/>
<strong>Author:</strong> Stefan Raitano ‚Äì Civil party</p>
<h4>üîπ 1. Purpose of this annex</h4>
<p>This note aims to draw the attention of the public prosecutor in a constructive and loyal manner to the legal, procedural and reputation-related implications of a potential decision to dismiss (non-prosecution), despite the extensive criminal file already compiled (PJ1‚ÄìPJ40), a first part of which (PJ15‚ÄìPJ39) has already been made publicly available on a legally structured platform (FX1).</p>
<h4>üîπ 2. Legal context</h4>
<p>The right of access to a judge (Art. 6 ECHR) and the right to an effective remedy in case of structural violations of civil rights imply that a civil party ‚Äì even in the event of a dismissal ‚Äì must have the means to publicly, legally and digitally express their complaint, without this being interpreted as obstruction or undue influence.</p>
<p>The current publication of PJ15‚ÄìPJ39 has already taken place within this legal framework, with prior notice (PJ15, PJ16) and integrity verification (SHA-256).</p>
<h4>üîπ 3. Procedural notification</h4>
<p>If a dismissal were to be considered without a thorough motivation report or without assessment of the submitted documents, the civil party would consider itself obliged to:</p>
<ul>
<li>also make the remaining pieces (PJ1‚ÄìPJ14), currently shared only in restricted circles, publicly accessible;</li>
<li>submit the entire course of the criminal proceedings to an independent legal review (possibly via external audit);</li>
<li>inform the competent Belgian authorities in a timely manner about the procedure and its societal implications.</li>
</ul>
<h4>üîπ 4. Purpose and non-threatening nature</h4>
<p>This notification has no threatening character. It is intended as a preventive and loyal signal within a legal framework, in the spirit of transparency, equality of arms, and respect for due process. It confirms the legal legitimacy of the parts already available (PJ15‚ÄìPJ39) and prepares a proportionate response only in case of an unmotivated or incomplete decision of dismissal.</p>
<h4>üîπ 5. Verification and status</h4>
<p><strong>SHA-256 verification:</strong> df87888b5ce7950b876e95cf61e7f46d45e72788a2b0e1bc33c9634700734505</p>

üì® Message received on 10 June 2025 at 17:38, sent by Ms.Opposing Party‚Äôs Lawyer:

"Dear Sir,

Please find attached, for proper order, a copy of the petition that we have just filed via e-Deposit, along with the accompanying documents. These documents are entirely known to you, as they merely provide an overview of the communication exchanged between the parties.

The case has not yet been assigned a docket number and no introductory hearing date has yet been determined. You will receive notification in due course.

Kind regards,

Opposing Party‚Äôs Lawyer, Attorney"

üìé Documents received:
1. Verzoekschrift huur Temmerman ‚Äì Raitano (termination).pdf
2. Stukkenbundel.pdf

These two documents were transmitted without any reference to PJ32, the in-effect procedural freeze, or the public prosecutor. The content of the "verzoekschrift" summarizes previous exchanges in a partial and unilateral manner, without any mention of the active criminal procedure. The document also contains an explicit request for early termination of the lease agreement, without adversarial process or acknowledgment of the ongoing case, which may be interpreted as a veiled form of pressure aimed at unilateral eviction.

---
üìå Legal elements retained in PJ34:

1. The response occurred after the expiration of the freeze imposed by PJ32 (9 June 2025 at 14:26), without any formal reply within the allotted timeframe.
2. The submission of a unilateral civil petition, without prior notification or commitment to the four PJ32 conditions, constitutes a clear violation of the stabilization framework.
3. This action immediately triggers the PJ33 effect: exclusive continuation on criminal grounds.
4. The lack of coordination with the public prosecutor (no copy, no reference to case file COR/470) constitutes procedurally disloyal behavior.
5. The indirectly intimidating nature of the act ‚Äì through accumulation of annexes and reactivation of a civil conflict ‚Äì constitutes a disguised attempt at judicial pressure.
6. The request for lease termination without alignment or respect for the criminal channels constitutes an eviction attempt in breach of fundamental procedural safeguards.

---
üì£ FX1 Conclusion

PJ34 officially registers this procedural violation and was submitted to the public prosecutor in Leuven on 10 June 2025 at 20:15, with a loyal copy to the opposing counsel. Any further attempt at parallel civil proceedings will henceforth be regarded as abusive.

All future communication must strictly pass through the public prosecutor. The FX1 system records this response as sealed, opposable, and time-stamped.

<p>From: [Opposing Party‚Äôs Lawyer]
To: [Mr. Raitano]
Subject: Technical Coordination ‚Äì Longin Intervention

Dear Mr. Raitano,

Since you refuse to have any direct contact with my client, can you confirm to me that you will contact Longin to schedule an appointment for a camera inspection, unclogging, and the preparation of a technical report?

My client does not know when you will be home (and available) to receive the company. The entire process is being unnecessarily complicated due to your refusal to communicate directly.

Can you also answer the following questions (already asked several times by my client):

- Front door subsidence: Without a photo, the construction firm cannot schedule an intervention and the problem remains unaddressed.
- Blocked drain: How long has the sewer been clogged? Are the toilets still functioning?
- Dishwasher: According to Ixina, there may be a leak at the door causing further damage to the kitchen, especially to the skirting board and the door panel. This is a priority issue and cannot be ignored. Please provide an update. You were to be contacted by BSH for an intervention‚Äîhas this occurred? Cf. email of 29/04/2025.
- Garden fence: This needs to be repaired to prevent further damage. My client has been waiting for over three weeks for your availability to execute this. Cf. email of 07/05/2025.

Let it be perfectly clear: there is no question of "intimidation" or "pressure." My client seeks a resolution and explains who bears which costs based on the identified cause.

As previously indicated, we are continuing with the preparation of a petition to dissolve the lease at your expense. At this point, no normal (let alone constructive) contact is possible.

Sincerely,  
[Opposing Party‚Äôs Lawyer]

Subject: Intervention ‚Äì Unclogging and Inspection

Dear Stefan,

Please respond to the points below so that the interventions can be carried out:

- The tenant (you) is invited to contact Longin (or another company) for an intervention: camera inspection, unclogging, and a detailed technical report.
- If the issue is not a technical defect, the costs are to be borne by the tenant, and you may contact your fire insurance.
- If it is a technical defect, the costs and repairs fall to the construction company.

Please send me all the photos‚ÄîI have not received them.

I am also still awaiting your response to my email of 03/06/2025 (attached).

Best regards,  
[Landlord]

<p>From: [Opposing Party‚Äôs Lawyer]
To: [Mr. Raitano]
Subject: Follow-up to your report of 2 June 2025

Dear Sir,

I do not understand why you state that there was no intervention or response following your report dated 2 June 2025.

My client contacted you promptly and repeatedly with specific questions about the issues you reported, to which you did not respond. These emails are again attached, along with a request that you promptly inform my client so she can take the necessary steps and properly inform the companies involved.

You speak of a ‚Äútotal contact ban‚Äù with my client while simultaneously demanding that she schedules an intervention within seven days. When my client contacts you in that regard, you do not respond to the questions but instead email the public prosecutor alleging harassment. This is completely absurd.

To be clear: a landlord‚Äôs failure to intervene immediately in the event of an issue with the rented property does not constitute a criminal offence.

In fact, your conduct is obstructing the resolution of the issues for which you are addressing my client. She has also noted that you do not properly maintain the garden, and that you clean the dishwasher up to three times a day with vinegar, which damages the seals and causes further damage to the skirting boards and kitchen cupboards.

Furthermore, you have blocked my email address while insisting on communicating only by registered post‚Äîyet you continue to send numerous emails, each containing defamatory statements.

My client also notes that your ‚Äúwebsite‚Äù remains online.

You are thereby creating a completely untenable situation for my client, which renders any normal landlord-tenant relationship impossible and compels her to incur additional costs due to our ongoing involvement.

We will therefore take the necessary steps to prepare a petition seeking the termination of the lease at your expense.

In addition, we are taking steps to obtain further information on the criminal proceedings you have initiated and are exploring options available to my client in this regard, including seeking legal costs before the council chamber.

This correspondence is addressed to you under all reservations and without any prejudicial acknowledgment.

Sincerely,  
[Opposing Party‚Äôs Lawyer]

<strong>Subject:</strong> Voluntary payment confirmation ‚Äì Judgment No. 25A782/1 ‚Äì Justice of the Peace of Leuven</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Raitano,</p>
<p>We acknowledge receipt of your message below and confirm that the payment has also been received in good order on our third-party account.</p>
<p>Could you, for the sake of completeness, confirm that you will continue to pay the full rent in the future, including indexation amounts, as stipulated by the judgment of the Justice of the Peace?</p>
<p>We are also very surprised that, without our client‚Äôs consent, you created a publicly accessible website on which our client‚Äôs personal data is processed and which outlines the legal procedures that are allegedly pending between the parties.</p>
<p>Contrary to your assertions, you can under no circumstances invoke the exceptions under Articles 6(e) and 6(f) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The processing of personal data is absolutely not necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in you. Nor is the processing of our client‚Äôs personal data necessary for the purposes of your legitimate interests.</p>
<p>The website includes an overview of documentation filed in the course of the procedures and allegedly aims to (publicly!) provide access to the said documents and to ‚Äúdocument‚Äù a legal dispute.</p>
<p>It is completely unclear to us why you have created this website. If you wish to have an overview of the documentation and timeline related to the dispute, this can perfectly well be done through a Word document stored privately. There is absolutely no necessity, legal basis or justification to make such matters public without our client‚Äôs consent. You can fully exercise your rights without the existence of this website.</p>
<p>By means of this letter, you are therefore formally requested to take the website offline immediately. Should you fail to do so, our client will initiate the necessary steps to seek judicial termination of the lease agreement, also considering the fact that you are not maintaining the garden properly, that you are accusing our client of potentially criminal conduct (which our client finds utterly incomprehensible on the basis of which offenses you believe a criminal complaint could be filed), and so on. The trust of our client has been completely destroyed by your actions ‚Äì understandably so.</p>
<p>Our client obviously hopes that it will not have to come to that.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,<br/>[Opposing Party‚Äôs Lawyer]<br/>[Redacted professional contact details]</p>
