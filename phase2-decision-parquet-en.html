  📅 June 19, 2025 – inappropriate communication by the opposing party’s lawyer  
  <br/>
  📎 UID : fx1-pj53-20250619-fr  
  <br/>
  This document documents an **inappropriate contact** from the opposing party’s lawyer on June 19, 2025, where they attempted to obtain a copy of a document without following the formal procedures, which constitutes a **violation of the principle of procedural neutrality**.  
  This contact is considered an attempt to apply undue pressure on the ongoing procedure. As a result, the civil party insists that any **future communication with the public prosecutor or the opposing party must go through formal and legal channels** in order to preserve the integrity of the procedure.

    🗳️ Political notifications sent – 17, 25 & 27 June 2025
  </h2>

  <p style="color: #334155; font-size: 0.95em;">
    Three formal notices were sent to the 
    <strong>Belgian and Flemish Parliaments</strong> to denounce the 
    <strong>ongoing institutional inertia of the public prosecutor’s office</strong> in case 
    <strong>COR/470 – PB/2500031</strong>, despite the legally structured filing of 
    <strong>PJ40 to PJ75</strong>.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #475569;">
    The third alert (27 June) confirms that the prosecutor was formally notified of an attempt to evict a family with two young children within 30 days, during an ongoing criminal procedure, based on demonstrably false statements. 
    It highlights the absence of any concrete judicial intervention despite the evidence on file.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #475569;">
    All messages were sent under the FX1 – Ultima++ protocol, in three languages, with timestamped validation and 
    <strong>exclusive copy to the public prosecutor of Leuven</strong>. 
    As of PJ75, no further copy is sent to the opposing party.

<h2>📈 Procedural Dynamics – Cumulative Escalation</h2>
<ul>
<li>⚖️ <strong>Initial refusal of mediation</strong> (6–9 June 2025, see PJ32–PJ33) followed by the **receipt of a unilateral civil filing on 10 June 2025**, **officially registered on 17 June 2025**, without consultation with the public prosecutor.</li>
<li>🧾 <strong>Hearing without substantive counter-argument</strong> (30 June 2025), followed by indirect pressure and insinuations against the FX1 publication channel (documented in PJ48–PJ53).</li>
<li>🛡️ <strong>Complete criminal filing</strong> (PJ1 to PJ46), with no substantive response from the opposing party → followed by indirect pressure and insinuations against FX1.</li>

<li>🧠 <strong>Indirect pressure</strong>: documented between 27 May and 3 June 2025 (cf. PJ16 to PJ18), these acts include ambiguous wording, intimidating signals, and a lack of formal disavowal.</li>
<li>🔇 <strong>Strategic silence</strong>: no formal response or disavowal was issued despite loyal notifications sent via e-Deposit and documents PJ33 to PJ46.</li>
